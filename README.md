# Isio Developer Technical Test

This test revolves around a refactoring excercise called The Gilded Rose.

It can be completed in any of the following programming languages:
- C#
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
- TypeScript
- Visual Basic


## How to complete the test

Download or Fork the code in this repository and complete the test using your programming language of choice.
For each language, there is a unit test file and an example simulation program to help get you started.

When your solution is ready, send us the link to your submission (e.g. public Github repository or similar). 
Don't forget to include instructions on how to run your solution, especially if you have introduced any new frameworks.

⚠️ Please do not submit PRs with test solutions directly against this source repository! They will be rejected.

As the task is refactoring based, a solution is widley open to developer interpretation and offers the opportunity for a candidate to showcase their broader skillset. 

There is no *correct* solution as such. Instead, you may be invited to justify your solution based on your approach and the technical design decisions you have made.

Feel free to go above and beyond the initial requirements specification if desired. For example, you may think of an additional requirement and illustrate how your refactored code allows you to implement this efficiently.

You can spend as long as you like working on your submission, however a typical solution should take no more than 2-3 hours.

## Gilded Rose Requirements Specification

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you may already know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in `Quality` as they approach their sell by date.

We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us, however its codebase is very basic and is becoming increasingly difficult for us to maintain when we want to add or update functionality. 

Your task is to improve the quality of our codebase, and also add a new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

- All `items` have a `SellIn` value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the `items`
- All `items` have a `Quality` value which denotes how valuable the item is
- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

- Once the sell by date has passed, `Quality` degrades twice as fast
- The `Quality` of an item is never negative
- __"Aged Brie"__ actually increases in `Quality` the older it gets
- The `Quality` of an item is never more than `50`
- __"Sulfuras"__, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in `Quality`
- __"Backstage passes"__, like aged brie, increases in `Quality` as its `SellIn` value approaches;
	- `Quality` increases by `2` when there are `10` days or less and by `3` when there are `5` days or less but
	- `Quality` drops to `0` after the concert

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

- __"Conjured"__ items degrade in `Quality` twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the `UpdateQuality` method and add any new code as long as everything
still works correctly. However, you must __NOT__ alter the `Item` class or any of its properties.
